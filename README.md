### Project 1: PID Controller for Temperature Control
This project involves modeling and implementing a temperature control system using a PID controller on an Arduino Uno. The system's objective is to maintain a setpoint temperature by utilizing feedback from a temperature sensor. The PID controller adjusts the heating or cooling output based on the difference between the measured temperature and the setpoint, ensuring precise temperature regulation in real-time.

### Project 2: Parking Lot Controller with Clock
Description: The aim of this project is to control a car parking lot with a capacity of a few tens or hundreds of spaces. The parking lot features two entry zones, one exit zone, and is divided into two floors. The control system was implemented using Petri nets and executed on an FPGA. Additionally, the project includes considerations for timekeeping mechanisms, incorporating functionalities such as daily, annual, or perpetual clock features.
