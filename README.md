# Microcontroller Projects

## Overview:

This repository is a compilation of microcontroller projects utilizing popular microcontroller platforms such as Arduino, PIC24, and ESP-based systems.

### Project 1: Arduino Temperature Control System with PID
Description: This project involves modeling and implementing a temperature control system using a PID controller on an Arduino Uno. The system's objective is to maintain a setpoint temperature by utilizing feedback from a temperature sensor. The PID controller adjusts the heating or cooling output based on the difference between the measured temperature and the setpoint, ensuring precise temperature regulation in real-time.

### Project 2: Parking Lot Controller with Clock on FPGA
Description: The aim of this project is to control a car parking lot with a capacity of a few tens or hundreds of spaces. The parking lot features two entry zones, one exit zone, and is divided into two floors. The control system was implemented using Petri nets and executed on an FPGA. Additionally, the project includes considerations for timekeeping mechanisms, incorporating functionalities such as daily, annual, or perpetual clock features.

### Project 3: Data Acquisition Device with PIC24
Description: Utilizing the Explorer16 microcontroller platform, design a data acquisition system with 4 analog and 5 digital channels. Employing UART communication and analog sensor configuration, the project focuses on real-time monitoring.

### Project 4: Integration of Data Acquisition Systems
Description: Integration of a Data Acquisition Device (DAD) on PIC24 and a Digital Sensor (SD) on Arduino, with communication facilitated via the I2C protocol. Additionally, a Python-based Application (App) on PC enables configuration, monitoring, and activity logging, fostering efficient communication and user interaction in data acquisition processes.

### Project 5: ESP-Based Energy Efficiency Monitoring System
This ESP-based system monitors temperature, light intensity, and motion, logging data to an SD card and sending it to ThingSpeak for cloud storage and visualization. It's controllable via the native app ESPRainmaker, and compatible with Google Home and Amazon Alexa for voice control.
